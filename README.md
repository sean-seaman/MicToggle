# MicToggle
This AutoHotKey script toggles the mic off and on with Alt+M, with auditory cues for muting/unmuting and a visual indicator for when muted.

To toggle the right device, use analysis.exe (compiled from a script found [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/SoundSet.htm)) to find the device number and name for your mic, and edit the DeviceName and DeviceNumber in MicToggleSettings.ini accordingly. Mine, for instance, were 6 and MASTER, respectively.

Executable files included for those who aren't about that autohotkey life.

There's some cool wizardry in there made by VxE of the AutoHotKey forums which allows for windows behind the visual indicator to be interacted with by opening a hole in the window, I do not claim it as my own. Got it [here](https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/34900-mouse-click-through-window/).

My friend made me the mic icon. Thank you, Jesse.
