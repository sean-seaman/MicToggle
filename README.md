# MicToggle
This AutoHotKey script toggles the mic off and on with Alt+M, with auditory cues for muting/unmuting and a visual indicator for when muted.

My mic is device 6 on my computer, so make sure to change that for yourself. Use the [soundcard analysis script](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/SoundSet.htm) to find the device number for your mic.

There's a little wizardry in there which belongs to VxE of the AutoHotKey forums, I do not claim it as my own.
