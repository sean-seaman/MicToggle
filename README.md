# MicToggle
This AutoHotKey script toggles the mic off and on with Alt+M, with auditory cues for muting/unmuting and a visual indicator for when muted.

My mic is device 6 on my computer, so make sure to change that for yourself. Use the [soundcard analysis script](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/SoundSet.htm) to find the device number for your mic.

There's some cool wizardry in there made by VxE of the AutoHotKey forums which allows for windows behind the visual indicator to be interacted with by opening a hole in the window, I do not claim it as my own. Got it [here](https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/34900-mouse-click-through-window/).

My friend made me a mic icon. Thank you, Jesse.
